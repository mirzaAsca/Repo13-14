                The marathon is a long-distance race with an official distance of 42.195 kilometres (26 miles 385 yards),
                usually run as a road race. The event was instituted in commemoration of the fabled run of the Greek
                soldier Pheidippides, a messenger from the Battle of Marathon to Athens, who reported the victory.
                The marathon can be completed by running or with a run/walk strategy. There are also wheelchair divisions.
                <br>
                <br>
                The marathon was one of the original modern Olympic events in 1896, though the distance did not become
                standardized until 1921. More than 800 marathons are held throughout the world each year, with the vast
                majority of competitors being recreational athletes, as larger marathons can have tens of thousands of participants.

                Olympic weightlifting, or Olympic-style weightlifting, often simply referred to as weightlifting, is a sport
                in which the athlete attempts a maximum-weight single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates.
                <br>
                The two competition lifts in order are the snatch and the clean and jerk. The snatch is a wide-grip,
                one-move lift. The clean and jerk is a close-grip, two-move lift. Each weightlifter receives three
                attempts in each, and the combined total of the highest two successful lifts determines the overall
                result within a bodyweight category. Bodyweight categories are different for male and female competitors
                and change over time. A lifter who fails to complete at least one successful snatch and one successful
                clean and jerk also fails to total, and therefore receives an "incomplete" entry for the competition.
                The clean and press was once a competition lift, but was discontinued due to difficulties in judging proper form.
                <br>
                <br>
                In comparison with other strength sports, which test limit strength (with or without lifting aids), weightlifting
                tests aspects of human ballistic limits (explosive strength); the lifts are therefore executed faster—and with
                more mobility and a greater range of motion during their execution—than other strength movements.
                <br>
                <br>
                The lifts performed in the sport of weightlifting, and in particular their component lifts (e.g. squats, deadlifts,
                cleans), are commonly used by elite athletes in other sports to train for both explosive and functional strength.

                Jogging is a form of trotting or running at a slow or leisurely pace. The main intention is to increase physical
                fitness with less stress on the body than from faster running but more than walking, or to maintain a steady speed
                for longer periods of time. Performed over long distances, it is a form of aerobic endurance training.

                <br>
                Jogging is running at a gentle pace, its definition, as compared with running, is not standard. One definition
                describes jogging as running slower than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h). Running is sometimes defined as requiring
                a moment of no contact to the ground, whereas jogging often sustains the contact.

                Gymnastics is a sport that includes physical exercises requiring balance, strength, flexibility, agility, coordination,
                and endurance. The movements involved in gymnastics contribute to the development of the arms, legs, shoulders,
                back, chest, and abdominal muscle groups. Gymnastics evolved from exercises used by the ancient Greeks that included
                skills for mounting and dismounting a horse and from circus performance skills.
                <br>
                <br>
                The most common form of competitive gymnastics is artistic gymnastics, which consists of for women (WAG), the events
                floor, vault, uneven bars, and beam. For men (MAG), it consists of the events floor, vault, rings, pommel horse,
                parallel bars, and horizontal bar. The governing body for gymnastics through out the world is the Fédération
                Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG). Eight sports are governed by the FIG, which include Gymnastics for All,
                Men's and Women’s Artistic Gymnastics, Rhythmic Gymnastics, Trampoline (including Double Mini-trampoline),
                Tumbling, acrobatic, and aerobic. Disciplines not currently recognized by FIG include wheel gymnastics, aesthetic
                group gymnastics, men's rhythmic gymnastics, TeamGym, and mallakhamba.
                <br>
                <br>
                Participants in gymnastics-related sports can include young children, recreational-level athletes, and competitive
                athletes at varying levels of skill, including world-class athletes.

                Basketball, colloquially referred to as hoops, is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players
                each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball
                (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in
                diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing
                team from shooting through their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the
                three-point line, when it is worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated
                to shoot a technical foul is given one or more one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the
                end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play
                (overtime) is mandated.
                <br>
                <br>
                Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate,
                both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots—the lay-up, the
                jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots;
                either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard.
                It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the
                ball with both hands then resume dribbling.

                Climbing is the activity of using one's hands, feet, or any other part of the body to ascend a steep
                topographical object. It is done for locomotion, recreation and competition, and within trades that rely
                on ascension; such as emergency rescue and military operations. It is done indoors and out, on natural and
                man-made structures.

                Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, usually for recreation, sport, exercise, or survival.
                Locomotion is achieved through coordinated movement of the limbs, the body, or both. Humans can hold their
                breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming within weeks of birth, as a survival response.
                <br>
                <br>
                Swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities, and in some countries, swimming
                lessons are a compulsory part of the educational curriculum. As a formalized sport, swimming features
                in a range of local, national, and international competitions, including every modern Summer Olympics

                Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot.
                Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground
                (though there are exceptions). This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with
                the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or
                legs in an inverted pendulum fashion. A feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass
                mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously, with
                energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity. The term running can
                refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting.
                <br>
                <br>
                Running in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy.

                Cycling, also called bicycling or biking, is the use of bicycles for transport, recreation, exercise or sport. People
                engaged in cycling are referred to as "cyclists", "bicyclists", or "bikers". Apart from two-wheeled bicycles, "cycling"
                also includes the riding of unicycles, tricycles, quadracycles, recumbent and similar human-powered vehicles (HPVs).
                <br>
                <br>
                Bicycles were introduced in the 19th century and now number approximately one billion worldwide. They are the principal
                means of transportation in many parts of the world.
                <br>
                <br>
                Cycling is widely regarded as a very effective and efficient mode of transportation optimal for short to moderate distances.
